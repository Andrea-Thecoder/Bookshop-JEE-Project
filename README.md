Assigned exercise during the JEE (Jakarta) training course (Labfortraining). 
The task was to create a Servlet with corresponding JSPs for managing a library. Insert and retrieve data from the database.

This is the first exercise where we are working on a project that operates with a database (associated in Git, note: the names of the books/authors are humorously ironic!).

This exercise is a work in progress; during the course, we will continue to work on this project. I will post several updates to this project as necessary.

We used JDK 21 and Apache Tomcat v9.0.x on Eclipse.
